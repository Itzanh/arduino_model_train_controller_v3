# Model Train Controller

Open Model Train Controller is a software that can control different types of model trains from a computer through a browser, letting you become a â€œtrain dispatcher" of you model.

This software can control the signals of the model through microcontroller units (like Arduino, etc.) that are connected then to the computer. This software is entirely open source and free software published under the GNU AGPL license.

The code for the web dispatching interface, the server, and the code necessary for the microcontroller units are included in the repositories.
